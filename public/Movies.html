<h1>Best movies of all time according to Gary.</h1>
<h2>My top three</h2>
<hr />
<hr />

<h1>1.</h1><h2>Avatar</h2>
<p>This is the only film that I have enjoyed in 3D, and the CGI in this movie is out of this world.</p>
<h1>2.</h1><h2>Gangsters Paradise</h2>
<p>The storyline in this film is really powerfull, it also has an amazing score.</p>
<h1>3.</h1><h2>The Philosophers Stone</h2>
<p>I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, but it's great to dream.</p>
